	      <p>Martin Paulus, M.D. and his collaborators at Laureate Institute for Brain Research are conducting a research study to find out more about individuals' attitude in experiencing certain life events and to test the reliabilithy of psychological tasks. There will be approximately&nbsp;100 subjects that will participate in this study.</p>
	      <p>If you agree to be in this study, there are two&nbsp;sessions to complete:</p>
	      <p><strong>Session 1</strong></p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Part 1: Survey</p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 60px;">This is a survey about general attitide of life events that will take approximately 30-60 minutes. You will&nbsp;first be asked about general attitudes about life and than&nbsp;Questions regarding your attitude of certain life events. In this part, you will be asked to provide a number between 0 and 100 that indicates how likely you think an event may happen to you (e.g. lost keys). Then you will be given a statistic that says how often these things actually happen (e.g. 10%). You will then be asked again to provide your estimation.</p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Part 2: Dot Probe Task</p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 60px;">This is a psychological task where you will complete 120 trials of images being displayed on screen and presented with a red bar before and after the images are shown. Your job is to determine whether the orientation of the bar were the same or different by using the keyds on your keyboard. The exact instructions will be given to you when you reach this part.</p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
	      <p><strong>Session 2 (done at least 24 hours after session 1 has been completed)</strong></p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Part 1: Same Survey as Session 1</p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Part 2: Same Task with different images.</p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">You may provide an email address&nbsp;to remind you when 24 hours has been passed after the completion of the 1st session. Once this session has been completed, you will be given a code where you may submit on Amazon Mechanical Turk to receive your $3 reward for your time and effort.</p>
	      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>Though there is no foreseeable risk for participating this study, you may experience a little discomfort when being asked about your current mood or estimating the likelihood of certain negative life events. Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may stop this HIT at any moment when you feel uncomfortable.   For any other question, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jtouthang@libr.net?Subject=Amazon MKTURK%20TASK" target="_blank">jtouthang@libr.net</a>.</p>
	      <p>No personally identifiable information will be collected in this study.</p>
